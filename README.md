## Hi, I'm Arjun ðŸ‘‹

I'm a systems engineer at Microsoft, working on high-performance networking infrastructure in Azure. I write systemd drivers and userspace components in Rust.

Outside of work, I'm interested in distributed systems, systems programming, and clean software design. Occasionally, I tinker with personal Rust projects and try to learn something new.
