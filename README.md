## Hi, I'm Arjun ðŸ‘‹

I'm a systems engineer at Microsoft, focused on high-performance networking in Azure. Most of my day-to-day work involves writing systemd drivers and Rust userspace components for Linux.

This GitHub mainly contains university-era projects and occasional side experiments â€” not a showcase of my production work, which lives behind walls (for now). Still, feel free to poke around.
